[CloudCannon](http://cloudcannon.com) is a service which provides a CMS for Jekyll websites, they also provide hosting. We're going to use CloudCannon to allow our client to update the website.

**Important**: CloudCannon detects that it's a Jekyll website by looking for a **_config.yml** file in the website root. Add **_config.yml** to your website root (it can be empty for now) and push it to GitHub.
