### Start with static

You do not need to learn _all_ of Jekyll to get started. A Jekyll site starts as static HTML which you gradually integrate Jekyll features into.

We'll be using one of the thousands of free HTML template for this guide. Of course, you can easily build your website from scratch using any CSS or JavaScript framework you desire. One of the big advantages of using Jekyll is you have complete control over all the source code.

Download and unzip the [Creative Template](/creative.zip).

### Running Jekyll

Now let's run Jekyll on the website. Open your terminal and run the following commands:

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd ~/Downloads/creative # or wherever you've unzipped the template
$ jekyll serve
{% endhighlight %}

Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). If all has gone well it'll show the website! This may not seem particularly exciting but let me explain what's actually going on here.

Jekyll is monitoring changes on your website. Anytime a file is updated it rebuilds the site, puts the resulting static website in the `_site` directory, then serves it live on port 4000.

We can leave this running and get on with adding some cool Jekyll features.
