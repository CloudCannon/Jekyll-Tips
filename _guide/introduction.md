This guide will give you a step-by-step introduction to Jekyll. We'll download a free HTML 5 template, convert it into a Jekyll website, add a blog and make it updatable for clients or non-technical users. Let's get started!

### What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator. It takes source files and generates an entirely static website. This is different from how a typical CMS such as Wordpress works. With Wordpress when a visitor goes to a page, that page is generated on the fly. With Jekyll, the entire website is generated upfront so visitors are simply served static files.

### Why use Jekyll?

There's been huge trend towards static technologies mostly to the complexity of current systems. Jekyll is:

* **Simple** - There's far less moving parts required for a Jekyll website. This makes Jekyll websites extremely fast and simple to build.

* **Fast** - Jekyll websites are among the fastest on the internet. There's no time spent generating a page, the web server simply needs to return a file.

* **Secure** - Jekyll websites are secure because it's just a static website. You don't need to worry about installing security patches or worrying if a plugin has vulnerabilities.

* **Scalable** - There's no backend processing on Jekyll websites which makes them insanely scalable.

* **Source Controlled** - The entire website including all the content can be source controlled. This gives you the entire history of the website and the ability to roll back to any version.
