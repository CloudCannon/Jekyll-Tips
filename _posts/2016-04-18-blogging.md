Blogging is one of Jekyll's main use cases. Blog posts live in a `_posts` directory and each post is stored in its own file. The file name of a post is important, the beginning has the date when the post was or will be published, then there's the title and finally, the extension. By default, the blog posts are written in one of two languages, Markdown or HTML. We'll create a new file for our first post: `_posts/2016-04-03-chocolate-chip-cookies.md`.

In our post we'll start with empty front matter. We need this empty front matter to tell Jekyll that this isn't just a static file and it needs some processing. Then we'll add our Markdown content.

The chocolate chip cookie was invented by Ruth Graves Wakefield. She owned the Toll House Inn, in Whitman, Massachusetts, a very popular restaurant that featured home cooking in the 1930s. Her cookbook, Toll House Tried and True Recipes, was first published in 1936 by M. Barrows &amp; Company, New York. The 1938 edition of the cookbook was the first to include the recipe "Toll House Chocolate Crunch Cookie" which rapidly became a favorite cookie in American homes.

We'll repeat this for another post, `_posts/2016-04-04-sourdough-bread.md`.

Sourdough bread is made by the fermentation of dough using naturally-occurring lactobacilli and yeast. Sourdough bread has a mildly sour taste not present in most breads made with baker's yeast and better inherent keeping qualities than other breads, due to the lactic acid produced by the lactobacilli.

Now we have two blog posts on our site, let's have a page which lists all the posts. We'll create `blog.html` in the root of the site and add some basic front matter for the layout and title.

~~~html
{% raw %}
---
layout: page
title: Blog Page
---
{% endraw %}
~~~

Next we'll output the blog posts in an unordered list, each post will have a link and title. Jekyll gives us access to an array of all the posts at `site.posts`. A post object has special properties. `url` is the URL for the generated post page, `date` is (by default) the date specified in the file name and `title` is (by default) the title specified in the file name.

~~~html
{% raw %}
...
<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
{% endraw %}
~~~

When we click on a post it takes us to the generated page.

The generated page currently has no styling so let's fix that with a layout. We'll create `_layouts/posts.html`, inherit the page layout then output the title, date and content. Jekyll automatically converts the markdown content into HTML.

~~~html
{% raw %}
---
layout: page
---

<h2 class="spacing">{{ page.title }}</h2>
<p>{{ page.date }}</p>

{{ content }}
{% endraw %}
~~~

Now we need to add the layout in `_posts/2016-04-03-chocolate-chip-cookies.md` and `_posts/2016-04-03-chocolate-chip-cookies.md`.

~~~html
{% raw %}
---
layout: posts
---
...
{% endraw %}

![Formatted blog post](/img/casts/blogging/formatted-post.png)

That's almost there except the date format looks a bit weird. We can run it through a date filter (which we'll cover in another tutorial) to fix the formatting.

~~~javascript
{% raw %}
...
<p>{{ page.date | date: '%B %d, %Y' }}</p>
...
{% endraw %}
~~~
