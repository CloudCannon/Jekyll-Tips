Most blogs have an RSS feed to push content out to readers. There's two ways we can add a Atom or RSS feed to our Jekyll site: either using Liquid or a Jekyll plugin. Using a plugin is the best way because the code has been tested by hundreds if not thousands of people. However, it's still useful to learn how to implement RSS using pure Liquid as some Jekyll hosting environments restrict plugins and it's good to understand how it works.

To begin with we need to understand what a RSS feed actually is. A RSS feed is an XML document which has basic meta data about a site, followed by a list of content items (usually blog posts) which will typically have a title, description, publish date and link.

Here's an example of a simple RSS feed.

~~~xml
{% raw %}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<rss version="2.0">
  <channel>
    <title>RSS Feed Exmple</title>

</rss>
{% endraw %}

When someone subscribes to an RSS feed their RSS aggregator will periodically check this document for new items.

Using Liquid we can output an XML file with this format for our site. First we'll create `/feed.xml` with the following content.

~~~xml
{% raw %}
---
layout: null
---
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<rss version="2.0" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
  <channel>
    <title>Bakery Store - Articles</title>
    <description>Your latest baking news</description>
    <link>{{ site.url }}</link>
    {% for post in site.posts %}
      {% unless post.draft %}
        <item>
          <title>{{ post.title | xml_escape }}</title>
          <description>{{ post.content | xml_escape }}</description>
          <pubDate>{{ post.date | date_to_xmlschema }}</pubDate>
          <link>{{ post.url | prepend: site.url }}</link>
          <guid isPermaLink="true">{{ post.url | prepend: site.url }}</guid>
        </item>
      {% endunless %}
    {% endfor %}
  </channel>
</rss>
{% endraw %}
~~~

This loops over our blog posts and outputs their metadata in an RSS XML format. You might of noticed we're using a variable `site.url` which isn't defined yet. Let's go ahead and define it in `_config.yml`.

~~~yaml
...
url: http://bakery-store.example.com
...
~~~

We just need to add a link to the RSS feed to `<head>` in `_layouts/default.html`.

~~~html
...
<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="Bakery Store RSS" href="/feed.xml">
...
~~~

Now when we go to `/feed.xml` on the live site we see the full feed.

~~~xml

          <title>Where Did The Cookie Come From</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;The chocolate chip cookie was invented by Ruth Graves Wakefield. She owned the Toll House Inn, in Whitman, Massachusetts, a very popular restaurant that featured home cooking in the 1930s. Her cookbook, Toll House Tried and True Recipes, was first published in 1936 by M. Barrows &amp;amp; Company, New York. The 1938 edition of the cookbook was the first to include the recipe “Toll House Chocolate Crunch Cookie” which rapidly became a favorite cookie in American homes.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>What Is Sour Dough</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Sourdough bread is made by the fermentation of dough using naturally-occurring lactobacilli and yeast. Sourdough bread has a mildly sour taste not present in most breads made with baker’s yeast and better inherent keeping qualities than other breads, due to the lactic acid produced by the lactobacilli.&lt;/p&gt;

So that's the Liquid method. Now let's try using the Jekyll plugin. First we'll delete `/feed.xml` so there's no conflict. Create `Gemfile` in the root of the site and add the `jekyll` and `jekyll-feed` gem.

~~~ruby
{% raw %}
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'jekyll'

group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem 'jekyll-feed'
end
{% endraw %}
~~~

Next we'll replace the `<link>` we added to the `<head>` in the last section with a Liquid tag from the plugin.

~~~html
{% raw %}
...
{% feed_meta %}
...
{% endraw %}
~~~


The last step is to run `bundle install` on the command line to install `jekyll-feed`. When we run jekyll now we need to run with `bundle exec` to include the gem.

~~~bash
{% raw %}
bundle exec jekyll serve
{% endraw %}
~~~

Now when we navigate to `/feed.xml` on the live site we get a feed of our posts.

~~~xml
{% raw %}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

You can customize all the fields and add extra metadata such as an author. Check out the [jekyll-feed](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed) GitHub repository for more information.
